# Heart_Disease_ML_Project

This is our project on Classification Machine Learning. We imported,cleaned,analyzed and made predictions about whether a person with specific features has heart disease or not, found on kaggle.com.
This project is a collaboration between Alexandros Korolis (https://github.com/Alexandros-Korolis) and Theofilos Avramidis (https://github.com/Theo-Avra) .
